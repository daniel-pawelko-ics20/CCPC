PRINTING OUT WITHOUT USING SCIENTIFIC NOTATION:
    cout<<fixed<< a << endl;

    If i have a big number example:
        double a = -5279235.721231465;
        cout << a;
    ^ This will print: -5.27924e+06

    If we want to print the full number without scientific notation all we do
    is:
        double a = -5279235.721231465;
        cout <<fixed<< a;
    ^ This will print: -5279235.721231465

STORING SPACE SEPERATED SEQUENCE INTO ARRAY:
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    int array[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> array[i];
    }

    If we want to recieve a squence of integers or whatever in one line and
    store it but we dont know the size of the array at compile time, but we are
    given the input size at runtime then we can simply create an array with n
    elements and store it with a for loop

    The code above will work with input like:
        4
        0 5 4 3
    or
        6
        1 2 3 4 5 6

    Stuff like this where the size of the array is given at runtime through
    input or something similar
