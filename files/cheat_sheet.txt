HEADERS AND STUFF:
    Have you ever seen a c++ program that doesnt use headers, me neither.
    Few useful ones:
        #include <string> - used for string data type
        #include <iosteam> - used for input output(cout and cin)
        
        #include <bits/stdc++.h> - This is a special one, it should only be
                                    used when doing competitive programming 
                                    as you wont have to type out
                                    every header used(like string or iostream
                                    or cmath or smt like that)(might not work
                                    with other compilers other than gcc)

    Namespaces:
        using namespace std;
            This prevents you from writing std::cout or something similar
            everytime you call a keyword/function type thing every time.



INPUT:
    cin >> input_variable;

OUTPUT:
    cout << output;
    or
    cout << output << endl;

DATA TYPES:
The things inside the parenthases are called format specifiers
format specifiers arent really used when using cin and cout but are used for
printf and scanf, DONT USE PRINTF AND SCANF IN C++, they are really only use in
C and are considered "naughty" in C++.
    int("%d"): 32 bit integer
    long("$ld"): 64 bit integer
    char("%c"): 8 bit character type
    float("%f"): 32 bit floating point number
    double("%lf"): 64 bit floating point number
    string("%s"): Dynamically allocated memmory(Technaclly there is a limit but
                                                    not one you are likely to
                                                    exeed)

CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS:
    if(condition) {
        ***
    }
    else if(condition) {
        ***
    }
    else {
        ***
    }

ARRAYS:
    type name[size] = {val1, val2, val3...};
    Example:
        string a[9] = {"one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven",
        "eight", "nine"};

    ELEMENT AT INDEX:
        a[0] will get index 0 or "one"

STRINGS:
    string name = "asdasd";

    Strings are nice in C++ as we can sort of treat them as an array
    because...well its just an array of charachters. 

    LENGTH:
        name.size();

    CHAR AT INDEX:
        name[i];
